# Alignment Newsletter

[Website](https://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter/)

A weekly newsletter published by Dr. Rohin Shah.  Shah works  for the AI Alignment division of [Google DeepMind]() and describes himself as an effective altruist. He makes hiring decisions for this team that does "Alignment Forum style conceptual work" and has [recruited](https://twitter.com/rohinmshah/status/1513523985216155663)at effective altruist meetups. Dr. Shah also [ran](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/rohinmshah)the EA groups for UC Berkeley and University of Washington at some point before 2017 - this lines up with his [work](https://rohinshah.com/resume/) as a lecturer at UC Berkeley around the same time.
