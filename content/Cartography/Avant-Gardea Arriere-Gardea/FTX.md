FTX (short for "Futures Exchange") was a crypto exchange founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. The company operated the FTX Future Fund to provide funding to various effective altruism and AI existential risk related groups. Prior to its collapse, FTX was the second biggest individual funder of the effective altruism movement after [Open Philanthropy](Open%20Philanthropy.md).
