### Anonymous grants

Several of the people who have received money from EA Funds are anonymous. For example:
- One $15,000 grant from Q3 2023 was to an individual for "3 months pay for career pivot"
- Another grant from Q4 2022 was $14,416 for "dedicating 1-2 days per week over 1 year to running multiple rationalist communities".
- A $250,000 grant was given in 2023 to an anonymous "large conference hosting communities working on improving the long-term future" (TODO: figure out what this was)
- $8,000 was distributed in 2021 to "plug hole in finances while finishing PhD"
- EA Funds spent $4,528 in 2022 paying for an anonymous grantee's weekly therapy visits
- One $30,000 anonymous grant from Q3 2022 was simply for "PhD/salary top-up"

**Since 2021, EA Funds has distributed over $1.1 million to anonymous recipients as part of the EA Infrastructure Fund and another $2.9 million as part of the Long-Term Future Fund.** The Animal Welfare Fund has distributed a further $93,000 to unknown recipients since 2018.
