# Redwood Research

[Website](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/)


One of their research papers is called "Language models seem to be much better than humans at next-token prediction". This is expected, because humans aren't LLMs and don't ever perform next-token-prediction as part of their daily lives. The paper isn't peer reviewed, but rather exists as a [post on the Alignment Forums](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/htrZrxduciZ5QaCjw/language-models-seem-to-be-much-better-than-humans-at-next) (it has since been uploaded to Arxiv as well).
