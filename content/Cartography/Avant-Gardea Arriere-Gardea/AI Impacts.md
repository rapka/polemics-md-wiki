AI Impacts is a rationalist AI existential risk organization that is concerned about the "long-term impacts of sophisticated artificial intelligence". It was co-founded by Katja Grace, who previously worked for [MIRI](../Lesser%20Wrongia/MIRI.md). In a 2022 blog post about pausing AI, Grace [described](https://worldspiritsockpuppet.com/2022/12/22/lets-think-about-slowing-down-ai.html)her experiences with trying to convince others of AI risk; her therapist thought she was catastrophizing.

AI Impacts' biggest claim to fame is their 2022 [survey of AI researchers](https://aiimpacts.org/what-do-ml-researchers-think-about-ai-in-2022/). Dr. Nirit Weiss-Blatt has [heavily criticized](https://twitter.com/MelMitchell1/status/1649135315615903759) the survey, the presentation of its data in Tristan Harris' _The AI Dilemma_ documentary, and AI impacts' funding sources.
