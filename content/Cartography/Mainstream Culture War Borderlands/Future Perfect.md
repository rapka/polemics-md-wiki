Future Perfect has most recently received funding from effective altruist, [Jane Street](../Puzzalia/Jane%20Street.md) employee and [Anthropic](../Avant-Gardea%20Arriere-Gardea/Anthropic.md) investor James McClave. McClave switched from providing funding in his own name to using an otherwise non-functional charity named "BEMC Foundation".
