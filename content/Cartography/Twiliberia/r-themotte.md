# r/themotte

[Website](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/)

r/themotte is the now-archived subreddit for [The Motte](https://www.themotte.org/), a debate forum. The subreddit used to host similar content, but now only serves as an aggregator for the main site. The Motte describes itself as _"a place for people who want to move past shady thinking and test their ideas in a court of people who don't all share the same biases"_.

(TODO: understand rationality connection)
