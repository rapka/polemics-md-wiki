> "Another thought-provoking article is 'Zoophilia Is Morally Permissible' by Fira Bensto (pseudonym), which is just out in the current issue of [the Journal of Controversial Ideas]," Professor Singer wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
> "This article offers a controversial perspective that calls for a serious and open discussion on animal ethics and sex ethics," the Princeton University bioethics professor added, encouraging people to "read and ponder" the study promoting sex with animals.


##### Transphobia

>Pinker, who knows nothing about transsexualism, posted a short review of Bailey's book in the _Guardian_ in June 2003, about the time that the HBDG members realized that Bailey's book was generating a storm of negative feedback. The review was published in an entry of three short reviews under his name in the Summer 2003 Reviews in the Guardian, as follows:

This is the text of the review:
>A Devil's Chaplain (Weidenfeld & Nicholson) confirms that Richard Dawkins is not only a brilliant scientist and thinker but among the best prose stylists writing today. J Michael Bailey's The Man Who Would Be Queen (Joseph Henry) is an engaging book on the science of sexual orientation. Though highly sympathetic to gay and transsexual men, it has ignited a firestorm by claiming that transsexuals are not women trapped in men's bodies but have either homosexual or autoerotic motives. John Carey's The Intellectuals and the Masses (Faber) shows how many 20th-century literary intellectuals had a contempt for ordinary people comparable to Hitler's. Though a decade old, it is worth reading for the chastening continuity it shows with today's "social critics", down to their despising fast food and popular entertainment.
