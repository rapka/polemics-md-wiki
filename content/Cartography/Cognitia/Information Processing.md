> Steve: Yes. The younger the STEM faculty member, the less likely they are to agree with me. And a lot of the younger STEM faculty are, themselves, super woke and just think this is the right thing. And we need to change the way we teach the math course, or we need to change the way we teach freshman physics for these reasons. And I think the older that you are among the STEM faculty, the more you’re likely to quietly, without trying to get yourself into trouble, agree with what I’ve been saying. So it’s an unfortunate situation.
