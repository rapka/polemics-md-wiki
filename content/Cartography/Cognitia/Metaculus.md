Metaculus is an "online forecasting platform and aggregation engine". In practice, this largely means that it's a website for gambling on specific events happening, often related to technology and AI.

It was created by Max Wainwright, Greg Laughlin, and Anthony Aguirre. Aguirre also founded co-founded the [Future of Life Institute]().
