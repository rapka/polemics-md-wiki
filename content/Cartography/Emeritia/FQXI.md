# Foundational Questions Institute (FQxI)

[website](https://fqxi.org/)| [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundational_Questions_Institute)

Founded by Max Tegmark (also of [FLI](/content/wiki/Cartography/Emeritia/FLI) fame) and Anthony Aguirre. Notable members include [Scott Aaronson (Shtetl-Optimized)](/content/wiki/Cartography/Lesser%20Wrongia/Shtetl-Optimized).

### Goals

> FQxI’s goals are:
>1. To expand the purview of scientific inquiry to include scientific questions and research avenues fundamental to a deep understanding of reality but which are currently largely unsupported by conventional grant sources and academic institutions;
>2. To redress incrementalism in research programming by establishing or expanding new “islands” of understanding through flexible funding of high-risk, high-reward research in these areas;
>3. To create opportunities for meaningful convenings and useful collaborations between researchers working on the foundations of science;
>4. To make the pursuit of science more equitable by addressing the marginalization of students, researchers, and outreach specialists due to racism, sexism, ableism, and other oppressive biases that result in certain groups of people being underrepresented in the foundations of science;
>5. To improve science via research, reimagining, and prototyping of scientific practices and institutions.
>6. To increase public understanding of known and future discoveries in these areas and the potential implications for our worldview.

>FQxI, therefore, aims to support research and outreach that is:

>- Foundational—with potentially significant and broad implications for our understanding of the deep or “ultimate” nature of reality
>- Unconventional—enabling research that, because of its speculative, non-mainstream, or high-risk nature, would otherwise go unperformed due to lack of funding.
