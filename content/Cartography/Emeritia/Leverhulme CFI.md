## About

Funded by the [Leverhulme Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverhulme_Trust). As is par for the course with many EA organizations, the neutrality of the Leverhulme Trust Wikipedia page is [disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Leverhulme_Trust#Apparent_lack_of_neutrality).

## Finances

LCFI is funded by the Leverhulme Trust, created by English industrialist [William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lever,_1st_Viscount_Leverhulme). A large part of his fortune was created by his soap business's operation in the Belgian Congo. In a sort of attempt at proto effective altruism, he wanted to push for "moral capitalism" in the Belgian colony where he was sourcing workers. However, his "moral" jobs failed to interest the Congolese, so he instead relied on the well established system of forced labour that led to the deaths of millions during Belgian colonial rule. The book _Lord Leverhulmeâ€™s Ghosts: Colonial Exploitation_ covers this subject; it's unclear how much money was made from forced labor, but at least some of the money in the Leverhulme Trust came from it.
