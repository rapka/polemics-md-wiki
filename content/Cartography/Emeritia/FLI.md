## About

The future of Life Institute is founded by Max Tegmark of MIT.

https://futureoflife.org/ai/2-million-donated-to-keep-artificial-general-intelligence-beneficial-and-robust/

> $2 million has been allocated to fund research that anticipates artificial general intelligence (AGI) and how it can be designed beneficially. The money was donated by Elon Musk to cover grants through the Future of Life Institute (FLI). Ten grants have been selected for funding.
> Said Tegmark, “I’m optimistic that we can create an inspiring high-tech future with AI as long as we win the race between the growing power of AI and the wisdom with which the manage it. This research is to help develop that wisdom and increasing the likelihood that AGI will be best rather than worst thing to happen to humanity.”

## World building contest

[list of winners](https://worldbuild.ai/winners/)

from the [about page](https://worldbuild.ai/about/):

>Advanced, and potentially world-changing artificial intelligence is coming, even if we do not know exactly when or in what form. There have been many diverse predictions about what this change will bring. But left out of many of these predictions is the key question for humanity: what sort of future do we _want_?

>Depictions of the future in the media are overwhelmingly dystopian. This is partly caused by it being much easier to imagine all the ways in which things could go wrong than it is to problem-solve ways to achieve positive outcomes.

One of the reasons depictions of the future in the media are dystopian is because of fearmongering from groups like FLI.

>It is our hope that, by formulating detailed roadmaps towards a future that is desirable, the worldbuilds will inspire real-world initiatives. We will feature the prize-winning builds on FLI’s website and hope to work them into our overall institutional strategies, use them to find potential collaborators for future projects, and connect storytellers with material to inspire them to tell different stories about our future.

_Comment: Worldbuilding as a way of inspiring real world initiatives is how we got in this AGI mess in the first place._

### [Rules](https://worldbuild.ai/rules/)

The rules dictate that contestants should envision a world that is "plausible" and "aspirational". "Plausible" is defined as the following:

>_Plausible_ means that the world should be one that _could_ well happen. In particular it should be:
>
>- Consistent with today’s actual world;
>- Consistent with known science;
>- Not rely on any implausible “miracles” to make sense (though improbable events occur in any realistic world!)

AGI existing doesn't satisfy any of these points.

### Max Tegmark, Per Shapiro, and Nya Blagadet

Per Shapiro wrote an anti-vax article in November 2022 for the [Brownstone Institute](https://brownstone.org/articles/solidarity-argument-vaccination-false/), an anti-lockdown think tank founded by Jeffery Tucker, a libertarian Bitcoin advocate who has been [implicated](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2008/01/11/the-rockwell-files)in Ron Paul's infamous racist newsletters from the 80's and 90's.
