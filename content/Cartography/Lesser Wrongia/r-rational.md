[r.rational](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational) is the Rationality subreddit.

>"Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people [in honest pursuit of their goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality), as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.
