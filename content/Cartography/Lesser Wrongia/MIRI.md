### Jeffery Epstein donation

This news came as a [surprise](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/3JjKWWrKWJ8nysD9r/question-about-a-past-donor-to-miri/answer/i49RZQgoQZYrXdpis) to then-MIRI employee Rob Bensinger, who claimed that MIRI had declined funding from Epstein in 2016. He continued:
>We couldn’t initially find evidence of the donation in our records, so we had to go digging a bit; it was apparently seed money for OpenCog while they were getting up and running rather than money for “real” SIAI stuff, hence current staff being out of the loop.
