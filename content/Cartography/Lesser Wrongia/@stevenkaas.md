Rationalist blogger. Made aisafety.info with Rob Miles. He used to blog as Black Belt Bayesian from 2007 to 2009, but that blog is now deleted and only exists on the Internet Archive.

LessWrong user Grognor posted a [retrospective](http://grognor.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-black-belt-bayesian.html) of Black Belt Bayesian in 2016, describing Kaas' writing as "a lot more actively transhumanist, singularitarian, atheist, and more of a futurist than he is today".
