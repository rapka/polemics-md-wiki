# Weird Multicolored Sun Twitter

According to the [Hermetic Library](https://hermetic.com/wst/index), this is a "a particular post-rational self-organized phenomenon on Twitter". It may be a precursor to what is known today as "That Part of Twitter" or "TPOT".

A [Twitter List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/169564192/members) by LessWrong use Grognor appears to list all the accounts in this clique. Many appear to have been created or joined the group in 2014 and all of the accounts have biographies that read **"{WORD}, THIS."** in capital letters. There was also a short-lived [Tumblr Hashtag](https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/weird%20sun%20twitter) with the same name.

(TODO: Figure out WTF this means)
