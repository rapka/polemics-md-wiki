# Weird Multicolored Sun Twitter

According to the [Hermetic Library](https://hermetic.com/wst/index), this is a "a particular post-rational self-organized phenomenon on Twitter". It may be a precursor to what is known today as "That Part of Twitter" or "TPOT".

A [Twitter List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/169564192/members) by LessWrong user Grognor appears to list all the accounts in this clique. Many appear to have been created or joined the group in 2014 and all of the accounts have biographies that read **"{WORD}, THIS."** in capital letters. There was also a short-lived [Tumblr Hashtag](https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/weird%20sun%20twitter)  as well as a [LessWrong Hashtag](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/weird-sun-twitter/history) with the same name.

Grognor passed away in 2017. According to Reddit comments on [r/SneerClub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/10qypl1/comment/j6sjo2c/) and [r/slatestarcodex](
https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/e7168k/comment/f9ul1u8/), he died by his own hand. The second of these comments came from screenshots of Brent Dill from Ziz; see the [CFAR page](CFAR.md) for more details.

A [digital memorial]() for Grognor features a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Grognor/status/834923683244347392) from several months before his death:
> I will be dead soon.if you want to honor my memory,
> 
> become vegan
> don't pay attention to the news
> think hard
> create a posthuman eutopia

>Well. I read the google doc on the live site, about Grognor, and it was disappointing. Tldr: the author of the post, and someone associated with them, briefly knew "Grognor", who sadly killed himself. Couldnt find much interesting about/by Grognor. All seem to be very bright but radical and utopian rationalists, a lot of it is schizoid rambling about their projects without details or any sense of traction, plus a conviction that they're very important work saving the world etc. Maybe there's other good content but I didn't find it.
