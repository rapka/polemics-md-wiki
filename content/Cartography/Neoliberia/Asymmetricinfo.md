@asymmetricinfo is the twitter account of Mega Mcardle, another liberal blogger with terrible takes.



She supports "cracking down" on protestors 

> We should be very liberal in letting people protest, but not in the middle of the highway. If cities donâ€™t crack down, this is going to become the dominant form of protest, because it gets a lot of attention.
