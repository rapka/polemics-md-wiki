@asymmetricinfo is the twitter account of Mega Mcardle, a liberal blogger.

She [supports](https://twitter.com/asymmetricinfo/status/1744715096138416157) "cracking down" on protestors:
> We should be very liberal in letting people protest, but not in the middle of the highway. If cities donâ€™t crack down, this is going to become the dominant form of protest, because it gets a lot of attention.
