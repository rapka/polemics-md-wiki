# Wait But Why

[Website](https://waitbutwhy.com/) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_But_Why) |  [Twitter (Tim Urban)](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy)

### Elon Hype

One of its claims to fame was a 2017 post about Neuralink that was personally approved by [Elon Musk]() .

In this blog post, Urban describes himself as being "the dumbest person in the room" during a meeting with Neuralink's founders, including Elon. This seems to be unlikely to be true because Elon Musk is a very, very dumb person.
