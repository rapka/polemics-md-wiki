Collige's writeup:


Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and Elon Musk both have subscriptions to Crémieux - Musk once replied to him with a theory about [c-sections causing babies to have larger skulls](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1742409933411299706).

Balaji Srivasan has [cited](https://x.com/balajis/status/1777182483911741498) him in a claim that the city of San Francisco "fakes its crime statistics" whil Marc Andreessen of Andreessen-Horowitz has interacted with him a number of occasions ([1](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1743773874054115705), [2](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1775037437669957740), [3](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1779744740319326282)).

### Timeline

###### January 30, 2019

Crémieux makes his first Medium post called ["The Jewish Advantage"](https://cremieux.medium.com/the-jewish-advantage-f320be537a9a) about the alleged high intelligence of Ashekazi Jews, repeatedly citing race scientists J. Philippe Rushton, Arthur Jensen and Richard Lynn. He would post 5 more times between February 2019 and May 2020;  
four were on the topic of race and intelligence and two of those were dedicated to attacking Dr. Eric Turkheimer personally.

###### April 4, 2022

Jordan Lasker publishes ["About Those Baby Brainwaves: Why “Policy Relevant” Social Science is Mostly a Fraud"](https://www.cspicenter.com/p/about-those-baby-brainwaves-why-policy-relevant-social-science-is-mostly-a-fraud-full-report) with the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, a Substack publication run by [thinly veiled neo-nazi](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/richard-hanania-white-supremacist-pseudonym-richard-hoste_n_64c93928e4b021e2f295e817) Richard Hanania.

###### **October 13, 2022**

Jordan Lasker is included in an [article](https://www.chronicle.com/article/racial-pseudoscience-on-the-faculty) from *The Chronicle of Higher Education* entitled "Racial Pseudoscience on the Faculty" about the pseudoscientific race science publications of Bryan J. Pesta. The article focused on one of his papers called "Global Ancestry and Cognitive Ability", written with Jordan Lasker, John G.R. Fuerst, and Emil O.W. Kirkegaard. The article mentions another paper by the exact same authors (along with Jan te Nijenhuis) called "Racial and Ethnic Group Differences in the Heritability of Intelligence" that was [refuted](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916211017498) by Evan J. Giangrande and Eric Turkheimer in a paper of the own, calling Pesta et al.'s work **"an example of how racially motivated and poorly executed work can find its way into a mainstream scientific journal"**. Lasker did not respond to *The Chronicle*'s request for comment, though it was noted that his [Substack profile](https://substack.com/@jordanlasker850318) at the time referred to him as a PhD student at Texas Tech University.

###### **October 15, 2022**

Crémieux returns to Medium and writes a post called ["Fraud, Incompetence, or Both"](https://cremieux.medium.com/fraud-incompetence-or-both-d46c6fbc0551) accusing Giangrande & Turkheimer of committing fraud in the same paper featured in the *Chronicle* piece. He only refers to the authors of "Racial and Ethnic Group Differences" as "Pesta et al." without once mentioning the names of the co-authors.
###### October 29, 2022

Crémieux [launches his Substack](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/coming-soon), calling it "a newsletter about papers that need to be discussed".


###### May 20, 2024

Crémieux [indicates]() on Twitter that he's now associated with Warp, "the best automated payroll and compliance company, and the only one built for founders".

---

### Warp Payroll


Warp is a startup that provides payroll and compliance services to other startups. The company first had a Twitter presence in February 2023 and sporadically posted fairly typical promotion of their services. This changed abruptly around April 8, 2024 Warp's account started posting memes involving the company and its logo almost exclusively, including one with [Pepe the frog and the background color of 4chan](https://x.com/joinwarp/status/1809068636163776877). For some reason, this includes warning people not to learn the Rust programming language because it will [turn people trans](https://x.com/joinwarp/status/1806722236448919877), a bizarre "joke" echoed by [one of the company's employees](https://x.com/knowclarified/status/1808920724033155108).

Warp's other employees besides Crémieux also indicate a tendency towards right wing politics. They include a Pepe avatar that has simply tweeted ["retard"](), an e/acc who replied to a tweet from Crémieux in support colonizing Africa, and an account named "Feral Pawg Hunter" that [jokingly celebrated]() being mutual followers with people who are into race science.

In May 2024, Warp [raised $5.7 million from investors](https://x.com/ayushswrites/status/1787886434650554655) including Garry Tan's Y Combinator and Balaji Srinavasan, who has [called for](https://newrepublic.com/article/180487/balaji-srinivasan-network-state-plutocrat) a form of right-wing "tech Zionism" that "ethnically cleanses" Democrats from San Francisco.

Cremieux has appeared on an episode of *The Jolly Heretic* podcast titled [Bad Science vs Based Science](https://www.jollyheretic.com/p/bad-science-vs-based-science-cremieux) using a voice changer. *The Jolly Heretic*'s Substack publication advertises itself with the line "Fed up with our woke joke universities? Learn based science with The Jolly Heretic". Alongside Crémieux, the Heretic's podcast has featured Steve Sailer, a far-right writer who coined the euphemism "human biodiversity" for race science and has two episodes dedicated to Emil Kirkegaard.

Crémieux has also appeared on an episode of called *Subversive with Alex Kaschuta* (a podcast about "ideas that may not fit neatly into the Overton window", also with a voice changer. He's described as "popped up and exploded once the Twitter ban on wrongthink was somewhat lifted by the regime of Elon Musk" (recall that Elon Musk personally subscribes to him). In the podcast, Crémieux discusses the possibility of demographic collapse and discusses how he became a Twitter celebrity - he claims to often DM scientists offering "corrections" or his own information to their tweets.

One of the scientists Crémieux has reached out to was Dr. Julia M. Roher in response to a [blog post](https://www.the100.ci/2024/01/10/a-casual-but-causal-take-on-measurement-invariance/) about measurement invariance she wrote for The 100% CI. He linked to to a [preprint paper](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/r7e6f) written on the subject by **Jordan Lasker**.

# The Crémieux Experience

Cremieux has the eyes of a number of very powerful people:

![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240417175846.png)
![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240417175931.png)

That's not all-- he's also had regular conversations with [Marc Andreessen](Marc%20Andreessen.md) [on](./images/andreessen-cremieux-2.png) [various](./images/andreessen-cremieux-1.png) [occasions](./images/andreessen-cremieux-3.png).

Certain regular themes can be espied from Cremieux's Substack articles:

![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240417181052.png)
![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240417181118.png)
![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240417181217.png)
Obviously, this "data scientist" has a rather particular view of which kind of data he is most interested in. The noun "recueil" is French for "collection," making his name the "Cremieux Collection." Given his avatar, it is likely his name is a reference to an obscure French politician, [Adolphe Cremieux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Crémieux), who rather infamously excluded Muslim Arabs and Berbers from becoming French citizens through the Cremieux decree:

 `The decree allowed for native Jews to become French citizens while Muslim Arabs and Berbers were excluded and remained under the second-class ‘indigenous’ status outlined in the Code de l'Indigénat. This set the scene for deteriorating relations between the Muslim and Jewish communities, and later proved fateful in the Algerian War of Independence, after which the vast majority of Algerian Jews emigrated to France.`

In a video clip of the podcast, Crémieux claims to be

Indeed, it would seem that for Cremieux his identity as a Jewish man is very important to, and intertwined, with his work. Take [this podcast appearance](https://www.jollyheretic.com/p/bad-science-vs-based-science-cremieux), where he claims to be an Ashkenazi Israeli. Note, by the way, the emphasis on his anonymity, with the podcast interview taking place under the use of a voice changer, and the description hyping up his own untraceability:

`One of the most exciting of this new breed of online educators is Crémieux Recueil. Who is he? Don’t know. What does he look like? No idea. Is he even a he? We can’t be sure. However, Crémieux was kind enough to grant me a podcast, where we covered all manor of things Based, from the IQ of the Ashkenazis, why the Vikings were violent, the effect of selection events, and the need for anonymity in Based science.`

Analyzing his [substack](https://www.cremieux.xyz/) leads to a number of interesting data points. He has over six thousand subscribers-- not a nobody by any means, especially given what we know of the likely identity of some of those subscribers. An active podcaster, too. Exploration of [his archive](https://www.cremieux.xyz/) shows his earliest article to have been published in October 29th of 2022. 6,000 subs in a little under eighteen months is noteworthy, to say the least. His leaderboard is equally notable, in that it its top ranks include standouts like [[Richard Hanania]] (formerly top-ranked referrer) and Steve Sailer:

![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240417183849.png)
This all naturally leads to the question of: just who is Cremieux, and how did he get his substantial and influential following?
# The Chaser Institute for Advanced Race Science

Well, if you ask the Internet, prior to his rise as a Substack star, Cremieux inhabited the Internet as a redditor. That's the word on the street on both Twitter and Reddit. Not an unlikely proposition, given his views, but there's a particular user singled out over and over again as the likely culprit. Those communities that tracked and followed his output usually referred to him as TPO, as the full username of *TrannyPornO* was, perhaps obviously, considered a little too spicy for polite conversation. The record here is incomplete, but this is an overview of all the extant evidence.

A prolific user of Reddit, TPO was particularly active on the r/heredity (race science), r/BlackPillScience (race science) , r/psychometrics (race science), and r/Jewdank ("dank Jewish memes") subreddits. Indeed, the account happened to be a moderator of both r/heredity and r/psychometrics. Obviously, he also shared an affinity for transgender pornography. Goes without saying, really. The primary opponents, or hate-readers, of TPO were by and large a subreddit known as [r/sneerclub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/) whose community has presently disbanded. They uncovered a fascinating snippet, for example, of [TPO's activity on the Slate Star Codex subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/8xgoos/user_submits_their_modest_vision_for_a_fascist/), where he sports a flair proclaiming his greater-than-ninety-percent ideological alignment with the community while producing a [truly fascist screed of his personal views](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8xa97t/comment/e22rh1l/)-- only for the moderators on the SSC subreddit to later [classify that as a quality contribution](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/929hdd/yall_remember_that_heres_all_my_fascist_views/). Another useful thread from this community to understand the man and the myth is the time they [caught him](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/b3irbm/utrannyporno_invokes_galieo_absolutely_insists_on/) waxing poetic about the [superiority of the quantitative worldview](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/b3g8sv/comment/eiztqqq/). They [also discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/8zn3tx/ssc_discusses_alternative_family_arrangements/) his insane positions on [the evils of the "Male mating market."](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8z9qkp/comment/e2hzsay/)

Anyways, what's particularly relevant to us from this point is that, indeed, when Cremieux first started his Twitter account, the r/Sneerclub community was [immediately on him](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/12qbsfo/tpo_has_joined_twitter_been_tweeted_by_paul/) as the new identity of TPO. Their proof is this gallery of a reddit thread with its Unddit counterpart showing the full context:

![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240418194801.png)

![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240418194832.png)
Interesting stuff, to be sure, but that's only one ultimately second-hand display of evidence. Let's try and dig deeper, to see if we can't disentangle this further.

# Further Supporting Evidence: Cremieux to TPO, TPO to Lasker

For starters, we can find connections to Cremieux/TPO in the [comments of blogs](https://www.unz.com/isteve/is-love-colorblind-updated-a-third-of-a-century/#comment-6396963) blogs of individuals like Steve Sailer, again, a top referrer in Cremieux's blog. [This Y-combinator comment chain](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35950987) demonstrates a deleted commenter attempting to utilize Cremieux's blog post to endorse race science, only for someone to bring out the connection. The quest for TPO's real identity has been a long one, though, with the use of various . Around 2021, TheSneerClub [mentioned the revelation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/l8sv1q/comment/glgpm25/) that he "turned out not to be a Lichtenstein economist but a Jewish kid in Minnesota or someplace." It's verifiable evidence that TPO used to claim to be from Lichtenstein, but also claimed Jewish identity during this period: 

![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240424053909.png)
Interestingly, as he has been identified as a TheMotte poster, it is worth noting that the website [affirmatively displays some collective memory of him](https://www.themotte.org/post/94/what-is-your-favorite-motte-post), being described as one of their "best" posters by three distinct people. Fascinatingly, one commenter [describes a scenario where he was identified "on the Pumpkin Person blog"](https://www.themotte.org/post/94/what-is-your-favorite-motte-post/13360?context=8#context) as an American grad student who "sometimes publishes with Emil Kirkegaard." A search of the Pumpkin Person blog [uncovers a post estimating the IQ of 39 countries](https://pumpkinperson.com/2020/01/27/estimating-the-iq-of-39-countries-new-data-from-2015/) with [a particular comment by user "RaceRealist"](https://pumpkinperson.com/2020/01/27/estimating-the-iq-of-39-countries-new-data-from-2015/#comment-151817) connecting him to Jordan Lasker dated to 2020, around the time of the Sneer Club posts regarding his own cover story being blown. Querying Twitter's collective memory, as of 2023, describes the particulars by which Jordan Lasker's identity became interpellated with TPO and, thus, Cremieux, apparently over his own objections:

![](./images/Jordan%20Lasker/Pasted%20image%2020240424054920.png)
The document being mentioned in this Twitter thread has yet to be found.

Interestingly, one of the [earliest archived mentions](https://archive.ph/Zxqkl) of the name "Jordan Lasker" connects to a different, albeit banned, Reddit account in by the name of faliceer in what appears to be an anti-right-wing block list, [which according to historical record](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/4lm0y1/comment/d3oocjl/) appears to have been a Gamergate affiliated account obsessed with the evils of race-mixing. The full significance of this is unknown at this time but it is worth noting that the "faliceer" account no longer seems to exist. Perhaps another avenue worth exploring.

Regardless, the name "Jordan Lasker" is interesting, and in fact important, because wouldn't you know it, Richard Hanania [once recorded a podcast with a certain Jordan Lasker](https://www.everand.com/podcast/590481810/35-Baby-Brainwaves-and-Broken-Science-Jordan-Lasker-Richard-Hanania). The same Richard Hanania which happens to be one of Cremieux's top referrers (and who used to be his #1, in fact). And Jordan Lasker, in turn, [has done statistical analysis for Hanania as well](https://rpubs.com/JLLJ/HANTMFG). Obviously, none of this is quite substantive. The best strategy employed would likely be to look through Cremieux's blog to see reposts of Lasker's graphs and publications. But we believe this information is already sufficiently interesting to be worth sharing.

# So Just Who Is Lasker?
According to[ Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-Ero-X0AAAAJ&hl=en), with corroborating evidence [from a LinkedIN account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-l-b84457304/) and an appearance in Texas Tech University's own [affiliated publications](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/education/outreach-and-research/circle/documents/CIRCLE_Annual_Report_2022.pdf), Jordan Lasker is a Texas Tech University alumnus who used to publish papers utilizing his university-provided email. Bizarrely, that's not always the case, either. In [a 2019 paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-8611/1/1/10), Lasker identifies himself as an independent researcher from Atlanta, Georgia-- this one with a certain Kirkegaard mentioned earlier. There's [one paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2624-8611/1/1/34) that's worth dedicating a whole section to, where he lists himself as part of the economics department of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities-- again with Kirkegaard. He sure gets around.

# Not Lasker's First Rodeo

One salient piece of evidence connecting Jordan Lasker with the emergence of Cremieux Recueil is [the publication in the Chronicle of Higher Education](https://archive.ph/YJiOX) on *October 13th of 2022* of a takedown of a Cleveland State University professor, Bryan Pesta, that names Lasker as one of his co-publishers. A mere two weeks later, Cremieux would begin posting. Which is rather funny, because earlier that year Lasker had a substack publishing [under his actual name referencing the Hanania podcast appearance](https://substack.com/profile/85932726-jordan-lasker) which seems to lie abandoned now. Fascinatingly, Cid Standifer attempted to contact the University of Minnesota to confirm if Lasker worked there, receiving no reply. The ambiguity regarding any potential tenured position is worth underscoring somewhat. Trying to track down Lasker, aside from the frequent presence of his regular collaborators, is akin to trying to shoot down a moving target. So let's look at what Lasker's most frequent collaborator, and the world he inhabits, can tell us about him.

# Lasker, Race Science Launderers, and Rationalists

Cremieux/Lasker having a following among various Silicon Valley billionaires is bad enough as is. But combining his compatriots with some of the implications of Lasker's diaphanous academic credentials paints a very worrying picture indeed.

A name that comes up often within Lasker's publication history is [Emil O.W. Kirkegaard](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Emil_O._W._Kirkegaard). The full context of why Kirkegaard is a horrible human being is beyond the scope of this article. There are around four salient points relevant to the Lasker scenario:

1) This is a man with a loathsome Internet posting background prior to his academic publictions to such an extent that he lost a case *in English libel court* against being called a pedophile. 
2) Despite having no academic credentials above a Bachelor's in Linguistics, he has managed to be associated with a number of pseudojournals with his publications primarily focusing on race science, organizing conferences on human intelligence, receiving grants from an institute whose publications were characterized as white supremacist by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
3) Despite these writings being demonstrably flawed on a methodological level, to say nothing of his lack of credentials, he clearly has access to collaborators within the academic world who are willing to co-publish with him.
4) Kirkegaard is the actual author of online activity ostensibly defaming him which was then documented by one [Heiner Rindermann](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Heiner_Rindermann)-- when it was proven that Kirkegaard was behind the posts in question, he ostensibly amended the documentation alleging such. 

That fourth point may seem oddly specific, but it is here to demonstrate that Rindermann maintains a familiarity with Kirkegaard beyond what can be easily explained away by their shared love of race science and race science conferences-- Rindermann is ostensibly aware of the man's own fraudulent behavior. So when, on a much more respectable-than-a-pseudojournal [PsyArXiv pre-print site](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/4bqc5), Lasker [receives a plaudit from Rindermann](https://plaudit.pub/endorser/0000-0002-5137-8922), it raises eyebrows. This is a German scholar associating with the frequent collaborator of a race scientist who he's supposedly been misled by just coincidentally happening to drop an endorsement into a psychology pre-print site that isn't in the constellation of pseudo-journals he's typically relegated to. In general, Kirkegaard's [presence in Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VKUbfSIAAAAJ) and [OSF's official website](https://osf.io/a2yfn/) is a bit of a rabbit hole, the salient issue here is that publication in pseudo-journals was only the start of a self-bootstrapping process by which he continually laundered his own academic credentials to greater and greater seeming legitimacy despite its major methodological flaws. Lasker, starting as a lowly "independent researcher," is obviously implicated in that process. And Rindermann, in mysteriously "falling for" Kirkegaard's seemingly-irrelevant activity on a random left-aligned Wiki and documenting it while also offering plaudits to Lasker, seems to be another element in this mechanism of legitimation.
