Jordan Lasker is the likeliest real identity of "Cremieux Recueil," a Twitter and Substack personality followed by many major players in the Silicon Valley space primarily focused on race science.

Certain regular themes can be espied from Cremieux's Substack articles:

Obviously, this "data scientist" has a rather particular view of which kind of data he is most interested in. The noun "recueil" is French for "collection," making his name the "Cremieux Collection." Given his avatar, it is likely his name is a reference to an obscure French politician, [Adolphe Cremieux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Crémieux), who rather infamously excluded Muslim Arabs and Berbers from becoming French citizens through the Cremieux decree:

 `The decree allowed for native Jews to become French citizens while Muslim Arabs and Berbers were excluded and remained under the second-class ‘indigenous’ status outlined in the Code de l'Indigénat. This set the scene for deteriorating relations between the Muslim and Jewish communities, and later proved fateful in the Algerian War of Independence, after which the vast majority of Algerian Jews emigrated to France.`

Indeed, it would seem that for Cremieux his identity as a Jewish man is very important to, and intertwined, with his work. Take [this podcast appearance](https://www.jollyheretic.com/p/bad-science-vs-based-science-cremieux), where he claims to be an Ashkenazi Israeli. Note, by the way, the emphasis on his anonymity, with the podcast interview taking place under the use of a voice changer, and the description hyping up his own untraceability:

`One of the most exciting of this new breed of online educators is Crémieux Recueil. Who is he? Don’t know. What does he look like? No idea. Is he even a he? We can’t be sure. However, Crémieux was kind enough to grant me a podcast, where we covered all manor of things Based, from the IQ of the Ashkenazis, why the Vikings were violent, the effect of selection events, and the need for anonymity in Based science.`

Analyzing his [substack](https://www.cremieux.xyz/) leads to a number of interesting data points. He has over six thousand subscribers-- not a nobody by any means, especially given what we know of the likely identity of some of those subscribers. An active podcaster, too. Exploration of [his archive](https://www.cremieux.xyz/) shows his earliest article to have been published in October 29th of 2022. 6,000 subs in a little under eighteen months is noteworthy, to say the least. His leaderboard is equally notable, in that it its top ranks include standouts like [[Richard Hanania]] (formerly top-ranked referrer) and Steve Sailer:

This all naturally leads to the question of: just who is Cremieux, and how did he get his substantial and influential following?

Well, if you ask the Internet, prior to his rise as a Substack star, Cremieux inhabited the Internet as a redditor. That's the word on the street on both Twitter and Reddit. Not an unlikely proposition, given his views, but there's a particular user singled out over and over again as the likely culprit. Those communities that tracked and followed his output usually referred to him as TPO, as the full username of *TrannyPornO* was, perhaps obviously, considered a little too spicy for polite conversation. The record here is incomplete, but this is an overview of all the extant evidence.

A prolific user of Reddit, TPO was particularly active on the r/heredity (race science), r/BlackPillScience (race science) , r/psychometrics (race science), and r/Jewdank ("dank Jewish memes") subreddits. Indeed, the account happened to be a moderator of both r/heredity and r/psychometrics. Obviously, he also shared an affinity for transgender pornography. Goes without saying, really. The primary opponents, or hate-readers, of TPO were by and large a subreddit known as [r/sneerclub](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/) whose community has presently disbanded. They uncovered a fascinating snippet, for example, of [TPO's activity on the Slate Star Codex subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/8xgoos/user_submits_their_modest_vision_for_a_fascist/), where he sports a flair proclaiming his greater-than-ninety-percent ideological alignment with the community while producing a [truly fascist screed of his personal views](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8xa97t/comment/e22rh1l/)-- only for the moderators on the SSC subreddit to later [classify that as a quality contribution](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/929hdd/yall_remember_that_heres_all_my_fascist_views/). Another useful thread from this community to understand the man and the myth is the time they [caught him](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/b3irbm/utrannyporno_invokes_galieo_absolutely_insists_on/) waxing poetic about the [superiority of the quantitative worldview](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/b3g8sv/comment/eiztqqq/). They [also discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/8zn3tx/ssc_discusses_alternative_family_arrangements/) his insane positions on [the evils of the "Male mating market."](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8z9qkp/comment/e2hzsay/)
