# Richard Hanania

Richard Hanania is a white nationalist, far-right Subtack author who frequently works with and appears alongside rationalists and effective altruists.

### "Why EA will become anti-woke or die"

In a February 2023 post titled ["Why EA will become anti-woke or die"](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/why-ea-will-be-anti-woke-or-die), Hanania bemoaned that the then co-CEO of Open Philanthropy didn't "laugh off" Time Magazine's [article about sexual harassment](https://time.com/6252617/effective-altruism-sexual-harassment/) in the EA communities. Hanania goes on claim that rationalism isn't woke because it's "disproportionately highly intelligent, non-conformist, and male" and that increased diversity in the movement has "brought all the usual problems". It's unclear which problems these are or how having more women involved exacerbates them.

A vice president of the University of Waterloo's EA club commented positively on Hanania's post, saying: 
>That being said, the long-term goal of EA branding itself as anti-woke is net positive, if indirectly. Even being vaguely associated with right-wing figures or groups is fairly good for filtering out status climbers. What probably happens if EA is anti-woke but doesn't solve this earlier problem is that it becomes dominated by grifters (like anti-wokeness writ large), but that's probably a better problem than the status quo.

It's worrying that a university club could see inviting anti-woke grifters as a step in the right direction.
