A vice president of the University of Waterloo's EA club commented positively on Hanania's post, saying: 
>That being said, the long-term goal of EA branding itself as anti-woke is net positive, if indirectly. Even being vaguely associated with right-wing figures or groups is fairly good for filtering out status climbers. What probably happens if EA is anti-woke but doesn't solve this earlier problem is that it becomes dominated by grifters (like anti-wokeness writ large), but that's probably a better problem than the status quo.
