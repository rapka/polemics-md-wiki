# Michael Vassar

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hifrommichaelv)

Longtime friend and of [Eliezer Yudkowsky](Eliezer%20Yudkowsky.md). He worked at [MIRI](../Cartography/Lesser%20Wrongia/MIRI.md) back when it was called SIAI.


### Metamed Research

See the [main page](../Organizations/Metamed.md)

### Wikiquote weirdness

Vassar doesn't have his own Wikipedia page (it redirects to the page for MetaMed), but he does have his own [Wikiquote page](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Michael_Vassar). 

### Harper's Magazine article

Michael Vassar was heavily feature in a [Harper's Magazine article](https://harpers.org/archive/2015/01/come-with-us-if-you-want-to-live/) about the rationality movement. In it, the author implies that Vassar drove drunk after a party:
> I wondered whether Vassar was drunk. He was about to drive one of his coworkers, a young woman named Alyssa, home, and he asked whether I would join them. I sat silently in the back of his musty BMW as they talked about potential investors and hires. Vassar almost ran a red light.

### Abuse Allegations


----
(TODO: sort all these notes)

Longtime associate of Eliezer Yudkowsky. He's alleged to have created the "Vassarite"

Has been accused of abuse and transphobia. 

Worked with him as the only other employee at MIRI in the early days, including when they were funded by Epstein.

I'm assuming you've heard what has happened with Vassar and Ziz at least up until the landlord attack incident last fall. The most recent bit of information about her is that an alert has been put out alleging that she's been involved in a double murder in Pennsylvania.

https://medium.com/@sefashapiro/a-community-warning-about-ziz-76c100180509

I haven't gone through every link in that document, but from what I can tell the basic facts appear to match the news articles and blog posts linked, but there's also quite a bit of speculation without sourcing mixed in. This is one of the areas where I'm not sure how wise it would be to publicize this document that only has a dozen likes because it appears to be very biased and doesn't talk about Ziz's allegations against CFAR/MIRI.

I also noticed this line in the alert: "Some members of the group apparently spent time together in Orleans County, Vermont before the murders."

I have no idea if this is true or whether it's a coincidence, but Orleans County appears to be where MAPLE mentioned in one of those tweets is. I talk about MAPLE more later, but it appears to be a traditional cult.

More information related to Vassar:
He founded MetaMed Research in 2013 with Jaan Tallin (Skype) and a rationalist ex-Magic: The Gathering player named Zvi Mowshowitz to provide "personalized medicine" for a large fee. It was funded by Peter Thiel and VentureBeat wrote a short piece on it:
https://venturebeat.com/business/peter-thiel-backed-metamed-brings-personalized-health-care-to-the-1-percent/
Yudkowsky wholeheartedly endorsed it, and said "Instead of just having “evidence-based medicine” in journals that doctors don't actually read, MetaMed will provide you with actual evidence-based healthcare." 

Sarah Constantin, another prominent rationalist was VP of research: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/03/sarah-constantin-replies-on-metamed.html

https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/f9s7pHub6hbsX7YKT/metamed-evidence-based-healthcare

MetaMed went bankrupt fairly quickly and appears to have not have been run very competently. Constantin posted a link to a post-mortem here:
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wmEcNP3KFEGPZaFJk/the-craft-and-the-community-a-post-mortem-and-resurrection
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzZd3jsG9YMU4DqHc62mMqKWtRer_KqFpiaeN-Q1rlI/edit?usp=sharing

She says that "you need a working payroll system", "you need to keep track of your finances" and "You need to keep track of everything you sell and everyone who works for you" which implies that none of those things were happening at some point! 	

Here's an archive of their website: https://web.archive.org/web/20150322033302/https://www.metamed.com/

I noticed that Vassar has an oddly flattering Wikiquote page. In particular, one of the quotes is from what appears to be a poem about rationality posted to Tumblr in which the reader "listens" and "wants to obey" Vassar's words: https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Michael_Vassar

I found the quote so weird that I looked at the edit history for his page. It reveals a few things:
- He went by "Michael Arc" for a time around 2017
- The person who created the page has been hurt by this ideology. It's very sad, he says "I think the world is going to end, probably quite soon...Everything else feels like a distraction...lately I have also been thinking that telling people about AI existential risk is maybe a terrible idea"

https://issarice.com/about

Harper's Magazine did a piece on the community in 2015 that appear to imply Vassar drove drunk??? It's a weird read. https://harpers.org/archive/2015/01/come-with-us-if-you-want-to-live/

You probably read this already, but here's an abuse allegation against Vassar, including details related to an RPG. An intense interest in fiction and nerd culture seems to be a pattern here given Yudkowsky's writing of HPMOR and Zvi's background as a Magic player.

https://twitter.com/RuffleJax/status/1009625312844550146

Financial documents from MIRI (under its old name) indicate that Vassar was receiving a salary of $52,000 from his position there in 2009; the only other paid employees were Yudkowsky and Tyler Emerson, who only received $5,000. This is notable because Jeffery Epstein is listed as donating $50,000 to the organization.

This accusation was done on this Tumblr post, along with what appears to be a screenshot of Yudkowsky's defense (which I haven't vetted). It says that current (as of 2019) staff of MIRI may not have known, but that seems makes it likely that Vassar did know at the time. Jeffery Epstein also funded a startup founded by Ben Goertzel, another ex-MIRI leader in 2013, well after he was arrested. Forbes did a positive article on it at the time, but it was naturally deleted.

A blog post from Goetzel at the time expresses his disagreements with Yudkowsky's philosophy but also praises Vassar. Some choice quotes:
"I think SIAI is performing a useful service by helping bring these sorts of ideas to the attention of the futurist community (alongside the other services they're performing, like the wonderful Singularity Summits). But, that said, I think the Scary Idea is potentially a harmful one. At least, it WOULD be a harmful one, if more people believed it; so I'm glad it's currently restricted to a rather small subset of the futurist community."
"The SIAI/OpenCog relationship diminished substantially when Tyler Emerson passed the leadership of SIAI along to Michael Vassar, but it was instrumental in getting OpenCog off the ground. I've also enjoyed working with Michael Vassar on the Board of Humanity+, of which I'm Chair and he's a Board member."

Ziz's accusation that Vassar is transphobic and possibly influenced people into detranisitioning seem to have a bit of merit. He appeared on a podcast where one topic of discussion was "gender coercion" in 2022. I couldn't find where in the 2 hour long video that portion is, unless it's at the end where he attacks Scott Alexander/Siskind in the context of the Ziz. I'm not really sure why he brought it up.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57gwRghJLdw

He appeared on the same podcast again, this time with the title "why lying might be good if you live in an evil world". It all sounds very conspiratorial, there's probably some very weird parts at some point. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Vky79h7N4I

He also tweeted what I think is a transphoic AI-related joke toward Yudkowsky last month. Yudkowsky still follows him on Twitter last time I checked.

Finally, it appears that someone was planning on filing a lawsuit against Metamed over their finances but the facebook links aren't visible to me. 

https://twitter.com/jmartiniii1968/status/590193117179027456

For context, most of the above links came from either the RationalWiki page on him, allegations from Ziz, or other anonymous allegations posted to these online communities. I wanted to double check the most serious ones as best as I can from primary sources.

>Some people asked for a continuation of my [#LessWrong](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LessWrong?src=hashtag_click) abuse thread. Some people told me I was polluting Kathy's legacy and twisting her words. Some people said I made up my abuse, that I threw in Michael Vassar and Andrew Rettek to get more views.

and the folks at r/Sneer Club for helping propagate Kathy's note. I also want to thank

[@bi_gendian](https://twitter.com/bi_gendian)

I also want to include links to some of Kathy's works before I talk about my own abuse some more. Her note is what allowed me to come out publicly in a way that could be spread.

>I only knew her through my domestic partner, to be exceedingly clear, and her vernacular is VERY DIFFERENT than mine. She, for example, believed that she was being targeted due to her facial structure and hormone levels. I do not support this.

>Her work is extremely useful as an insider's view though -- and as a testament to how far abusers will go to discredit and destroy one of their own, if they try to bring the abuses to light.

In light of the accusations, Anna Salamon of [CFAR](../Cartography/Lesser%20Wrongia/CFAR.md) [expressed regret](https://web.archive.org/web/20191204021029/https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/u8GMcpEN9Z6aQiCvp/rule-thinkers-in-not-out/comment/JLpyLwR2afav2xsyD) for how not warning people about Vassar.

>I used to make the argument in the OP a lot. I applied it (among other applications) to Michael Vassar, who many people complained to me about (“I can’t believe he made obviously-fallacious argument X; why does anybody listen to him”), and who I encouraged them to continue listening to anyhow. I now regret this.

>a friend complained to me that Michael would cause EAs to choose the wrong career paths by telling them exaggerated things about their own specialness. This matched my own observations of what he was doing. Michael himself told me that he sometimes lied to people (not his words) and told them that the thing that would most help AI risk from them anyhow was for them to continue on their present career (he said this was useful because that way they wouldn’t rationalize that AI risk must be false). Despite these and similar instances, I continued to recommend people talk to him because I had “ruled him in” as a source of some good novel ideas, and I did this without warning people about the rest of it. I think this was a mistake. (I also think that my recommending Michael led to considerable damage over time, but trying to establish that claim would require more discussion than seems to fit here.)

[Scott Alexander](../Cartography/Lesser%20Wrongia/Astral%20Codex%20Ten.md) echoed similar feelings of regret is his reply to Salamon.

>I should have thought more about meeting people in person, in which case I would have echoed the warnings you gave about Michael. I think he is a good example of someone who both has some brilliant ideas and can lead people astray, but I agree with you that people’s filters are less functional (and charisma is more powerful) in the real-life medium.

Another commenter chimed in:
>I decided to ignore Michael after our first in-person conversation, where he said I shouldn’t praise the Swiss healthcare system which I have lots of experience with, because MetaMed is the only working healthcare system in the world (and a roomful of rationalists nodded along to that, suggesting that I bet money against him or something).
