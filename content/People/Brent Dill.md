### Accusations

>“You need to become, like, 20% less resistant to cults”,

>“You need to just acknowledge me as the wizard and trust I know what I’m doing”

>As a community, we have failed to react to [Diego Caleiro](Diego%20Caleiro.md) for several years until his bad behavior was beyond justifiable. In the meantime, people have been hurt.

Brent pressured me into BDSM scenes with gear I hated, pain and discomfort well past my tolerance, insufficient safety protocols, and sometimes drug use.

>We had a good time on the second-to-last day of Burning Man 2015, and I was on MDMA at the time, so two weeks later he had me come to Folsom Street Fair with him, in bondage and on MDMA, in the hopes that the MDMA would be a general-purpose “make Elizabeth okay with things” drug [sic, name use is intentional]. It wasn’t. I had a terrible time, got stuck in the ballet boots, it took a long time to get me out because the laces got stuck, and he scolded me for crying because I was making him look bad.
