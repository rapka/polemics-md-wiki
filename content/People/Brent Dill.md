# Brent Dill


### Accusations

>“You need to become, like, 20% less resistant to cults”,

>“You need to just acknowledge me as the wizard and trust I know what I’m doing”

>As a community, we have failed to react to [Diego Caleiro](Diego%20Caleiro.md) for several years until his bad behavior was beyond justifiable. In the meantime, people have been hurt.

Brent pressured me into BDSM scenes with gear I hated, pain and discomfort well past my tolerance, insufficient safety protocols, and sometimes drug use.

>We had a good time on the second-to-last day of Burning Man 2015, and I was on MDMA at the time, so two weeks later he had me come to Folsom Street Fair with him, in bondage and on MDMA, in the hopes that the MDMA would be a general-purpose “make Elizabeth okay with things” drug [sic, name use is intentional]. It wasn’t. I had a terrible time, got stuck in the ballet boots, it took a long time to get me out because the laces got stuck, and he scolded me for crying because I was making him look bad.

CFAR eventually banned Brent as a response to the allegations, but only after several updates and apologies. A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneerClub/comments/9huy5q/comment/e6eq38a) on r/SneerClub shared the original email sent out to community members which declared CFAR's intent to not ban him.

>We think Brent and D had a relationship that caused lasting damage to D; we think Brent was partially culpable in this (we also think that both Brent and D would agree with both of these sentiments)
>
>We do not think Brent is a “bad actor,” or “malignant psychopath” or similar
>
>We are choosing not to ban Brent from any of CFAR’s spaces
>
>We do feel that Brent may have some kinds of “poor judgment” that might adversely impact his appropriateness for some kinds of authority positions within CFAR; see below for a more nuanced (though still limited, of course) description

Beyond clearing him of wrongdoing, the email went on to praise his character and defend him, claiming that he was "held to a higher standard than most".

> Brent also embodies a rare kind of agency and sense of heroic responsibility. This has caused him to take the lead in certain events and be an important community hub and driver. The flip side of this is that because Brent is deeply insecure, he has to constantly fight urges to seize power and protect himself. It often takes costly signalling for him to trust that someone is an ally, and even then it’s shaky.
> 
> Brent is a controversial figure, and disliked by many. This has led to him being attacked by many and held to a higher standard than most. In these ways his feelings of insecurity are justified. He also has had a hard life, including a traumatic childhood. Much of the reason people don’t like him comes from a kind of intuition or aesthetic feeling, rather than his actions per se.

Another member of CFAR's Alumni Community Disputes Council added even more praise for Brent at the end:
>The investigation of the council was partially because, at the time of investigation, Brent was in a relationship with {redacted name}, and we were worried that another toxic relationship was brewing and that Brent might be hurting her in a way that would echo previous harm. That relationship (which included serious BDSM and had a significant age gap) turned out to be pretty good, or at least worth trying. This reflects a way in which the toxic dynamic in 2016 was not solely on Brent, and that treating Brent as a villain is an unfair caricature.
 
 >Furthermore, Brent has been very cooperative and proactive in our eyes in working towards a place of healing and mutual understanding. In our attempts to resolve this conflict, D has been the sticking point on things like having conversations--not Brent. (This is meant to be a point of praise for Brent, not a slam on D; setting barriers is important to staying safe, and we recognize that it's hard to talk with, or even about, someone who has hurt you.)

It's unclear when the email was sent out, but the Reddit thread and [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/qPeamHQQ) of the email text were both posted on September 21, 2018.

An anonymous person called "Mittens Cautious" published three Medium posts from different people, all of which accuse Brent of misconduct. ["Brent, a warning"](https://medium.com/@mittenscautious/brent-a-warning-38e447c55ab0) and ["Warning 2"](https://medium.com/@mittenscautious/warning-2-153ed9f5f1f3) were uploaded on September 17 and September 19 respectively and contain stories of abuse from two different ex-partners. A third post called ["Warning 3"](https://medium.com/@mittenscautious/warning-3-8097bb6747b1) was authored by someone who didn't experience abuse, but claimed they were "part of a social environment that was shaped by Brent to keep a certain type of person close to him" and corroborates Warning 2.

> We were horrified to learn of the serious allegations of repeated consent-violation and lasting harm detailed in three Medium posts. ([Persephone](https://medium.com/@mittenscautious/brent-a-warning-38e447c55ab0), [T](https://medium.com/@mittenscautious/warning-2-153ed9f5f1f3), and [Jonathan](https://medium.com/@mittenscautious/warning-3-8097bb6747b1))
> 
>Today, we have taken the following actions:
>Brent is banned from all CFAR activities and spaces until the original ACDC recommendation—which suggested a ban was unnecessary—can be revisited by an improved due process. This is not a statement of judgment—we believe that a provisional ban would be an appropriate precaution for any allegation of this nature, proven or not.
  .
  We have disbanded ACDC. As things stand, the group is no longer in a position to accomplish its original mission for CFAR and the community.
 > 
>We are making the apology below, for the things we already understand to have been mistakes and sources of damage.
