CEO of Salesforce. He bought Time Magazine in 2018.

#### Salesforce & Generative AI

Salesforce partnered with [OpenAI](../Cartography/Technomundistan-Technophilistan/OpenAI.md) in 2023 to create "Einstein GPT", a version of GPT finetuned for CRMs. Salesforce also launched a [generative AI fund](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/generative-ai-investing/)which participated in [Anthropic's](../Cartography/Avant-Gardea%20Arriere-Gardea/Anthropic.md) funding Round C.

In an [interview](https://salesforceventures.com/perspectives/in-conversation-with-anthropic-co-founder-tom-brown/) with Salesforce's president, Anthropic co-founder Tom Brown claimed AGI already exists:
>“I think we already have weak AGI. You can talk with ChatGPT or Claude and it’s somewhat intelligent, and with each year it’s improving.”
>
>“Right now you may prompt the model to build a successful startup. It’ll try to do it, but it’ll get stuck. But as we add more compute, the model gets smarter. The model’s IQ goes up. So I think it would be surprising if the models suddenly stopped getting better. And then it’s a question of how much better can they get? One thing we don’t know is how far the model has to go for it to be an AI entrepreneur that could do a great job. But every year it seems like we’re getting more IQ points so at some point I think we’ll get models that are better at engineering than I am.”

#### AI x-risk views

Benioff has [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/18/we-dont-want-to-see-an-ai-hiroshima-salesforce-ceo-warns.html) this:
>"We don't want something to go really wrong. That's why we're going to, like, that safety summit. That's why we're talking about trust," Benioff said, [referencing a U.K. event last year.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/31/what-you-need-to-know-about-uk-ai-summit-attendees-agenda-and-more.html)

>"We don't want to have a Hiroshima moment. We've seen technology go really wrong, and we saw a Hiroshima. We don't want to see an AI Hiroshima. We want to make sure that we've got our head around this now."

> As Sam likes to say, we don't really know what's gonna happen next, but we all saw Minority Report. We saw War Games. We know about HAL. We saw the movie Her. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to fill it in.

>The poll was carried out in late June by the AI Policy Institute (AIPI), a U.S. nonprofit that advocates for “a more cautious path” in AI development.

>The polls also showed that 83% of Americans believe AI could accidentally cause a catastrophic event, and that 82% prefer slowing down AI development to account for that risk, compared to just 8% who would like to see it accelerated.

>For example, go-to-market function automation platform Tribble recently partnered with Private AI, a privacy-focused AI company, to use Private GPT, a product that redacts personally identifiable information before sending it through OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot.

>“We’re excited to apply the power of OpenAI’s technology to CRM,” **said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.** “This will allow more people to benefit from this technology, and it allows us to learn more about real-world usage, which is critical to the responsible development and deployment of AI — a belief that Salesforce shares with us.”
