>But here we also find something frightening about this approach: its terrifying ambivalence. An approach that understands human agency as an illusory interpretation of the exertion of force—a bi-product of mediated feedback amongst the flows of material processes—is definitionally unmoored from conventionally understood ethical or political commitments. We see this in what lead Srnicek and Williams to ultimately abandon the conceptual frame of left accelerationism. Critics of their projects, including Land, claimed that they had misunderstood where the engine of technological acceleration was located. From a traditional accelerationist point of view, it is not, as they claimed, possible to separate the progress, spread, and development of current technological tendencies from capital, because they are _constituted_ by capital. The theory-fiction on which accelerationism was based cannot undergo a political convention because it is a story about capital as an ambivalent force. This is why Land’s current work has led him to produce theory-fictional narrations of world history to hyperstitionally engage in the making of a world of neoreactionary CEO kings and hyper-racism. Which is to say: he has followed the tendencies of capital in all its violence.

>There is no doubt anywhere that matters: simply facts. Debate is idiot distraction, humanity is fucked, real machines never closed-up inside an architecture. Schizo-capital fission consists of vectors dividing between two noncommunicating phyla of nonpersonal multiplicity. First, pyramid control structures : white-clown pixel-face, concentrational social segments, EU-2 Integrated history-horizon Second, jungle-war machines: darkening touch densities, cultural distribution thresholds, intensive now-variation flattened out into ungeometrized periphery.

No community. No dialectics. No plans for an alternative state
