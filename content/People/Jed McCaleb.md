# Jed McCaleb

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jed_McCaleb)

Co-founder of the Stellar and Ripple crpytocurrencies and the Mt. Gox crypto exchange.

McCaleb has a [LessWrong](LessWrong.md) account and used it to make one [post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vEtdjWuFrRwffWBiP/we-have-to-upgrade)  in March 2023 about the need for humanity to become cyborgs in order to fight AGI:
>**There is no good outcome (for us) without humans themselves also becoming super intelligent.**

>I believe our goal should be to ensure humans are in control long enough to augment our mind with extra capability. (or upload but that seems further off) Iâ€™m not sure how this will work but I feel like the things that neuralink or science.xyz are doing, developing brain computer interfaces, are steps in that direction. We also need to figure out scalable technological ways to work on trauma/psychology/fulfilling needs/reducing fears. Humans will somehow have to connect with machines to become much wiser, much more intelligent, and much more enlightened. Maybe we can become something like the amygdala of the neo-neo-cortex.

### The Navigation Fund
