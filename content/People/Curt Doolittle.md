# Curt Doolittle

Doolittle founded the "Propertarian Institute", which has since been renamed to the "Natural Law Institute", though the [about page](https://naturallawinstitute.com/about-us/about/) still references the old name.

Curt has a [LessWrong](LessWrong.md) [account](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/curtd59)which has 3 comments from years ago in which he promotes the Propertarian Institute.

He was [critical](https://twitter.com/curtdoolittle/status/1726706142993350886) of the OpenAI/Sam Altman drama, calling it a "culmination of the GenY-GenZ, "Effective Altruism", Post-Capitalist, Power-Chick Fantasy" that contributes to the collapse of "the west". 

A [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exlibertarian/comments/cadio6/seduced_by_propertarian_institute/) from 2019 called "Seduced by Propertarian Institute".

In his [reading list](https://curtdoolittle.com/reading-list/), he praises [Steven Pinker](../Cartography/Twiliberia/@sapinker.md) for firing the " first salvo against pseudoscience in the social sciences" but is otherwise undecided on him.
