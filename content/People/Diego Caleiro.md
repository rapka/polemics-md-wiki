>A couple days ago [Sam Altman](Sam%20Altman.md) (ChatGPT [OpenAI](OpenAI.md)) wrote a text talking about AGI and taking it seriously in the OpenAI website. In the aknowledgements, he thanks a few of our folks, including the reasonable Paul Christiano, Nate Soares and Allan Dafoe – all of whom I know in person and vouch for as sincere EAs – [Helen Toner](Helen%20Toner.md), who I also know, and Holden Karnofsky, who I have always been suspicious of and continue to be, but many other people think he is a reasonable EA.

>A day before that, Sam Altman showed up with [Eliezer Yudkowsky](Eliezer%20Yudkowsky.md) and [Grimes](Grimes.md) ([Elon's](@elonmusk.md) ex) in a viral internet picture.

>The Day before, a podcast with Yudkowsky saying we are all going to die came out.
