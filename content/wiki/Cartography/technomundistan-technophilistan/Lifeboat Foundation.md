## About

Mission Statement from the [about page](https://lifeboat.com/ex/about):

>The Lifeboat Foundation is a nonprofit nongovernmental organization dedicated to encouraging scientific advancements while helping humanity survive [existential risks](https://lifeboat.com/ex/programs) and possible misuse of increasingly powerful technologies, including genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and robotics/AI, as we move towards the [Singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).
>
>Lifeboat Foundation is pursuing a variety of options, including helping to accelerate the development of technologies to defend humanity such as new [methods to combat viruses](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bioshield), effective [nanotechnological defensive strategies](https://lifeboat.com/ex/nanoshield), and even self-sustaining [space colonies](https://lifeboat.com/ex/arki) in case the other defensive strategies fail.

>We believe that, in some situations, it might be feasible to relinquish technological capacity in the public interest (for example, we are against the U.S. government [posting the recipe](https://www.kurzweilai.net/recipe-for-destruction) for the 1918 flu virus on the internet). We have some of the best minds on the planet working on [programs](https://lifeboat.com/ex/programs) to enable our survival. We [invite](https://lifeboat.com/docs/invitation.doc) you to join our cause!

>The Lifeboat Foundation is working on a prototype [Friendly AI](https://lifeboat.com/ai) and also has launched the world’s **first** [bitcoin endowment fund](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bitcoin).

### Leadership

President: [Eric Klien](https://lifeboat.com/ex/bios.eric.klien)
>A [cryonicist](http://alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html) since 1989, Eric served a stint as a member of the [Alcor](http://alcor.org/) Investment Advisory Board and for a time became deeply involved in cryonicist politics.

>Eric’s interest in Libertarian philosophy led him to found The Atlantis Project, with the goal of creating an independent floating city in the Caribbean Sea named [Oceania](http://oceania.org/) — a city independent of the limitations and bureaucratic failures of present day government. In its early stages, this project gathered a great deal of interest and was covered by media in the U.S. and around the world.
