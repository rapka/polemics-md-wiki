The [FAQ on Pronomos' website](https://www.pronomos.vc/knowledge) has a question called "What are the humanitarian benefits of charter cities?". This was changed from "How do Charter Cities relate to the Effective Altruism movement?", which can still be seen in the HTML of the page. In both cases, the answer links to a [research paper](https://chartercitiesinstitute.org/research/case-for-charter-cities-effective-altruism/)advocating for charter cities from a longtermist efffective altruism perspective.  Using [GiveWell](../Avant-Gardea%20Arriere-Gardea/GiveWell.md)'s formula paper's author offers an optimistic estimate that charter cities may be as much as 40x more effective than GiveWell's top charity recommendations. The paper also claims that an advantage of charter cities is that they can use labor practices that "host country may be hesitant or unwilling to reform on a nationwide level" as a result of their lack of lack of regulations; it's unclear exactly what these practices are or how they will affect workers.
