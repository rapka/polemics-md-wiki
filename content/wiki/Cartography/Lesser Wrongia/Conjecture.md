Conjecture is an AGI think tank with ties to EleutherAI.

Conjecture has [recommended](https://www.conjecture.dev/research/agi-in-sight-our-look-at-the-game-board) reading [Eliezer Yudkowsky's](../../People/Eliezer%20Yudkowsky.md) LessWrong posts. Yudkowsky has also contributed to Conjecture's [Information Hazard Policy](https://www.conjecture.dev/information-hazard-policy)

In October 2023, proposed an AGI regulation mechanism called [Multinational AGI Consortium (MAGIC)](https://www.conjecture.dev/research/multinational-agi-consortium-magic-a-proposal-for-international-coordination-on-ai). No consideration was paid to the feasibility or logistics of implementing this idea in real life.
