Rationalist blog written by Logan Strohl. Strohl was formerly married to [Eliezer Yudkowsky]().

Logan [advocates](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/evLkoqsbi79AnM5sz) for a form of rationalist "naturalism". He describes naturalism as "a label for a conceptual framework, investigatory discipline, and semi-formalized way of looking at and learning about the world".
