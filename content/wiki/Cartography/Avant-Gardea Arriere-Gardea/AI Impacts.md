AI Impacts is a rationalist AI existential risk organization that is concerned about the "long-term impacts of sophisticated artificial intelligence". It was co-founded by Katja Grace, who previously worked for [MIRI]().

AI Impacts' biggest claim to fame is their 2022 [survey of AI researchers](https://aiimpacts.org/what-do-ml-researchers-think-about-ai-in-2022/). Dr. Nirit Weiss-Blatt has [heavily criticized](https://twitter.com/MelMitchell1/status/1649135315615903759) the survey, the presentation of its data in Tristan Harris' _The AI Dilemma_ documentary, and AI impacts' funding sources
