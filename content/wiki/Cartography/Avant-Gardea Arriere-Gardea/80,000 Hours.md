# 80,000 Hours
[Website](https://80000hours.org/)| [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80,000_Hours)| [Twitter](https://twitter.com/80000Hours)

80,000 Hours is an organization that gives career advice and hosts a job board for people interested in "high impact careers". In practice, this means acting as the recruitment arm for the effective altruism movement. 80K Hours advocates from earning to give, EA, longtermism, and AI existential risk research.

## Finances

According to their [financial data](https://80000hours.org/about/credibility/evaluations/financial-accounts/), 80,000 Hours budgeted $5.62m on marketing in 2023, an increase of 146% from the the amount spent in 2022. They say that they decided to "fundraise extra from a specific donor and spend aggressively on marketing after making the 2022 budget". It's unclear who this specific donor was.

### Donors

80,000 Hours was part of [The Centre for Effective Altruism (now Effective Ventures)](/content/wiki/Cartography/Avant-Gardea%20Arriere-Gardea/CEA) until December 2023 when it [became independent](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4ebRNGi3aHWnCw5m8/80-000-hours-spin-out-announcement-and-fundraising-1) as a result of the FTX bankruptcy case. Their largest donor is [Open Philanthropy](Open%20Philanthropy.md). They also received a $50,000 grant from [YCombinator](../../Companies/YCombinator.md) to participate in a "nonprofit startup acceleration programme" (TODO: find this?).

The [donors page](https://80000hours.org/about/donors/) lists "several anonymous donors" under every tier besides the "Over Â£10 million" one.
