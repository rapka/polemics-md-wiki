- A $250,000 grant was given in 2023 to an anonymous "large conference hosting communities working on improving the long-term future" (TODO: figure out what this was)
- $8,000 was distributed in 2021 to "plug hole in finances while finishing PhD"
- EA Funds spent $4,528 in 2022 paying for an anonymous grantee's weekly therapy visits
- One $30,000 anonymous grant from Q3 2022 was simply for "PhD/salary top-up"
