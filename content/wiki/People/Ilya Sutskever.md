Ilya Sutskever is an AI researcher whose original claim to fame was the invention of the convolutional neural net with [Geoffrey Hinton](Geoffrey%20Hinton.md) and Alex Krizhevsky.
Sutskever was the Chief Scientist at [OpenAI](../Cartography/Technomundistan-Technophilistan/OpenAI.md) from its founding until he was ousted after failing to fire [Sam Altman](Sam%20Altman.md) during the corporate power struggle of late 2023.
