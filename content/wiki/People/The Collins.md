### pronatalist.org

The couple runs the pronatalism website [pronatalist.org](https://pronatalist.org/). Their view is that "demographic collapse" is underway because prosperity, gender equality, access to education, and technology have a "sterilizing" effect on most cultures that they want to reverse. 

The website was funded by [Jaan Tallinn](Jaan%20Tallinn.md) through the [Survival and Flourishing Fund](../Cartography/Lesser%20Wrongia/SFF.md) in 2022 to the tune of $482,000.
