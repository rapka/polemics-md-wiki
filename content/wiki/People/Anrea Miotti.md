Andrea Miotti is an AGI doomer that runs [Conjecture](https://ccc.inc/), a GPT-based coding tool and [Control AI](https://controlai.com/about-us). 

(TODO)


>We are campaigning for the creation of a Multinational Artificial General Intelligence Consortium (MAGIC). MAGIC would be an institution built on international collaboration, and the only institution in the world permitted to create advanced AI. By restricting the ability to create AGI to one international body, it can be ensured that AI is created safely, in a secure environment.


> Andrea Miotti (also working at Conjecture) is director of the campaign. Given that this plays against the interests of companies with billions of dollars, the funders wish to remain private for now.
