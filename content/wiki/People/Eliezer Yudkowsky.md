It's Yud.

Yud has generally in favor of trans rights from a philosophical standpoint. In a 2018 [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1067488107040145409), he said that "changing your name, asking people to address you by a different pronoun, and getting sex reassignment surgery, Is. Not. Lying". However, that same thread shows his sympathies to the Intellectual Dark Web, as he said "It'd be sad if the [#IDW](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IDW?src=hashtag_click) died on [the pronoun hill] hill of all hills".

Yud retweeted an interview with Lisa Littman who coined the transphobic propaganda ["rapid-onset gender dysphoria"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid-onset_gender_dysphoria_controversy). 

In 2020, he [argued](https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1269383834757259265)in favor of testosterone limits for cops as a means of reducing police violence.
