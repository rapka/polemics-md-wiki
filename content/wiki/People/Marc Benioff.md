Benioff has [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/18/we-dont-want-to-see-an-ai-hiroshima-salesforce-ceo-warns.html) this:
>"We don't want something to go really wrong. That's why we're going to, like, that safety summit. That's why we're talking about trust," Benioff said, [referencing a U.K. event last year.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/31/what-you-need-to-know-about-uk-ai-summit-attendees-agenda-and-more.html)

>"We don't want to have a Hiroshima moment. We've seen technology go really wrong, and we saw a Hiroshima. We don't want to see an AI Hiroshima. We want to make sure that we've got our head around this now."

> As Sam likes to say, we don't really know what's gonna happen next, but we all saw Minority Report. We saw War Games. We know about HAL. We saw the movie Her. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to fill it in.
