> Molyneux wanted his programmers to push the envelope with the AI so the creatures would pass the Turing Test, a personality and intelligence test that no artificial intelligence has ever passed. He even brought the game to MIT to show off the creatures' ability to learn, grow, and understand. When testing one creature's intelligence, Molyneux instructed it to eat only the most nutritious things it could find. When the creature was hungry it ignored all the food supplies and started swatting at its legs. Molyneux, confused about what the creature was trying to convey, observed this behavior until realizing that the creature was trying to eat itself, since it comprised the most nutritious thing in the game.
