# Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI)

[website](https://existence.org)

_not affiliated with UC Berkeley_

Their domain name is "existence.org"

### Funding

From their [faq page](https://existence.org/faq), they have been funded mostly by "large private donors". These include [Jaan Tallinn](../People/Jaan%20Tallinn.md), [Open Philanthropy](../Cartography/Avant-Gardea%20Arriere-Gardea/Open%20Philanthropy.md), and the Long-Term Future Fund of [EA Funds](../Cartography/Avant-Gardea%20Arriere-Gardea/CEA.md).

>Since our founding in 2017, BERI has been primarily funded by large private donors, including Jaan Tallinn, Open Philanthropy, and the Long-Term Future Fund. We also accept [donations from individuals](https://existence.org/donating). A partial list of BERIâ€™s donors is available [here](https://existence.org/transparency/#donors).

They also accept individual donations, but according to their [transparency data for 2023](https://existence.org/transparency/#donors), only ~$340,000 came from small donors, compared to $3.5 million and $885,000 from Open Philanthropy and the [Survival and Flourishing Fund](../Cartography/Lesser%20Wrongia/SFF.md).

 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-silverstein-30ab3629/)appears to indicate that a major donor in 2023, Alex Silverstein, works for [Anthropic](../Cartography/Avant-Gardea%20Arriere-Gardea/Anthropic.md). Additionally, $2,500 came from "Microsoft" with no individual donor named. However, it's worth noting that only donors willing to be public are listed on BERI's website.
