(Copied from wikipedia)
> The Sentience Institute was founded on the principle of [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism "Effective altruism"), a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others. The institute bills itself as, "an advocacy think tank researching and advising advocates on the most effective strategies to [expand humanity's moral circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_circle_expansion "Moral circle expansion")."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience_Institute#cite_note-2) Its founders, Kelly Witwicki and [Jacy Reese Anthis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacy_Reese_Anthis "Jacy Reese Anthis"), were working at [Sentience Politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience_Politics "Sentience Politics"), which was part of the Effective Altruism Foundation. Sentience Politics is now a nonprofit organization running political initiatives in the German-speaking area. Anthis had also previously worked at [Animal Charity Evaluators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Charity_Evaluators "Animal Charity Evaluators") as chair of the board of directors and then as a full-time researcher.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience_Institute#cite_note-introducing-3)
