Welcome to what is tentatively titled the "TESCREAL wiki". it aims to collect, organize, and critically analyze information about the transhumanist, Rationalist, effective altruism, longtermism, and AI existential risk communities.

Some of the information here has previously been compiled on other platforms such as [RationalWiki](https://rationalwiki.org)and [InfluenceWatch](https://www.influencewatch.org). However, those websites don't have a focus on sci-fi and effective altruism specifically; this project aims to collect this knowledge as it pertains to TESCREAL in an organized fashion. 

### Rationality Cartography

The inspiration for this project was a desire to understand an anonymously-made [map of the online Rationalist space](wiki/cartography/map_full.jpg) that was posted to [Scott Alexander]'s Astral Codex Ten blog in 2022. AI Panic has published an excellent breakdown of a [similar graph](https://www.aipanic.news/p/ultimate-guide-to-ai-existential)that is also used as a source.
