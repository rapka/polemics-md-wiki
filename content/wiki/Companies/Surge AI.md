> **Tell me more about your data labelers**
> Unlike typical data labeling companies and BPOs that outsource their data labeling to low-skilled labelers in third world countries who have minimal command of English or other languages, we build our workforce out of highly skilled and educated native speakers.
> For example, our Surgers come from all walks of life – whether they’re stay at home parents, teachers looking to earn extra money after school, Ivy League students paying their way through college, or software engineers interested in advancing AI.

> **What skills and backgrounds do your data labelers have?**

> Our personalization engine matches Surgers with the skills your data labeling projects need. This means that not only do we use native English speakers for your English labeling projects (as crazy as this sounds, this is rare in the data labeling world), native Spanish speakers for your Spanish labeling projects, and so on – but we also use Surgers with accounting and finance backgrounds for your financial categorization projects, actual Twitter users for your tweet labeling projects, gamers for projects labeling gaming messages, software engineers and CS grads for training coding AI assistants, and so on.
> If you need special skills and backgrounds, just ask!

> Surge claims to vet its workers for qualifications — that people doing creative-writing tasks have experience with creative writing, for example — but exactly how Surge finds workers is “proprietary,” Chen said. As with Remotasks, workers often have to complete training courses, though unlike Remotasks, they are paid for it, according to the annotators I spoke with. Having fewer, better-trained workers producing higher-quality data allows Surge to compensate better than its peers, Chen said, though he declined to elaborate, saying only that people are paid “fair and ethical wages.” The workers I spoke with earned between $15 and $30 per hour, but they are a small sample of all the annotators, a group Chen said now consists of 100,000 people. The secrecy, he explained, stems from clients’ demands for confidentiality.

A confidential workforce of 100,000 people sourced via "proprietary" methods.



### Shell companies

> Taskup.ai, DataAnnotation.tech, and Gethybrid.io all appear to be owned by the same company: Surge AI. Its CEO, Edwin Chen, would neither confirm nor deny the connection, but he was willing to talk about his company and how he sees annotation evolving.

(TODO: investigate shell companies)
