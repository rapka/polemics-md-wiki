###  "values"

>06 - We don’t deny Nature

>Humans are the product of millions of years of evolution. Evolutionary biologists have studied the way men and women act when seeking long-term partners. They behave differently. They have different preferences, different communication styles, and different ways of seeking long-term partners. Dating apps completely ignore sex-linked differences and provide unisex experiences. As a result, the way they generate “matches” has helped fuel a culture of short-term flings, rather than marriages. Keeper takes human nature seriously, which makes us more effective at matching people for long-term success.
