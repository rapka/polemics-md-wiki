Replit is an online IDE co-founded and initially developed by Amjad Masad.

Replit has recently integrated generative AI into their IDE. More notably, Replit has been tapped by [The Network State](../Cartography/Techliberia/@balajis.md) as a potential "parallel institution" to traditional computer science education.
