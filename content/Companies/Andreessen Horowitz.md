# Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)

Venture capital firm created by [Marc Andreessen](../People/Marc%20Andreessen.md) and Ben Horowitz.

a16z got into the [political donations game](https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/andreessen-horowitz-announces-foray-into-political-donations.html) at the end of 2023. According to Horowitz's [blog post](https://a16z.com/politics-and-the-future/) on the subject, their reasoning for this is to prevent regulation of the AI and crypto spaces, stating that "artificial Intelligence has the potential to uplift all of humanity" and that a16z will support "candidates who align with our vision and values specifically for technology".
