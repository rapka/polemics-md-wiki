This sequence of events involves longtime friend and associate of [Eliezer Yudkowsky](../People/Eliezer%20Yudkowsky.md) [Michael Vassar](../People/Michael%20Vassar.md) and a feud started against him by an ex-friend who goes by the name of ziz online.

### Testimony and takes from Scott Alexander

[Scott Alexander](../Cartography/Lesser%20Wrongia/Astral%20Codex%20Ten.md) described the situation as follows in a [thread](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/MnFqyPLqbiKL8nSR7/my-experience-at-and-around-miri-and-cfar-inspired-by-zoe/comment/4j2GS4yWu6stGvZWs) on GreaterWrong. His posts were in response to a thread from a rationalist describing her negative experience with [MIRI](../Cartography/Lesser%20Wrongia/MIRI.md) and [CFAR](../Cartography/Lesser%20Wrongia/CFAR.md) which in turn was inspired by a similar [post](https://medium.com/@zoecurzi/my-experience-with-leverage-research-17e96a8e540b) about [Leverage](../Cartography/Sufferia%20Cynicia%20Psychonaut%20Bay/Cynicia/Leverage.md).


>Jessica was (I don’t know if she still is) part of a group centered around a person named Vassar, informally dubbed “the Vassarites”. Their philosophy is complicated, but they basically have a kind of **gnostic stance where regular society is infinitely corrupt and conformist and traumatizing and you need to “jailbreak” yourself from it (I’m using a term I found on Ziz’s discussion of her conversations with Vassar; I don’t know if Vassar uses it himself). Jailbreaking involves a lot of tough conversations, breaking down of self, and (at least sometimes) lots of psychedelic drugs.**

>Vassar ran MIRI a very long time ago, but either quit or got fired, and has since been saying that MIRI/​CFAR is also infinitely corrupt and conformist and traumatizing (I don’t think he thinks they’re worse than everyone else, but I think he thinks they had a chance to be better, they wasted it, and so it’s especially galling that they’re just as bad). Since then, **he’s tried to “jailbreak” a lot of people associated with MIRI and CFAR—again, this involves making them paranoid about MIRI/​CFAR and convincing them to take lots of drugs.** The combination of drugs and paranoia caused a lot of borderline psychosis, which the Vassarites mostly interpreted as success (“these people have been jailbroken out of the complacent/​conformist world, and are now correctly paranoid and weird”). Occasionally it would also cause full-blown psychosis, which they would discourage people from seeking treatment for, because they thought psychiatrists were especially evil and corrupt and traumatizing and unable to understand that psychosis is just breaking mental shackles.

>Jessica talks about a cluster of psychoses from 2017 − 2019 which she blames on MIRI/​CFAR. She admits that not all the people involved worked for MIRI or CFAR, but kind of equivocates around this and says they were “in the social circle” in some way. The actual connection is that most (maybe all?) of these people were involved with the Vassarites or the Zizians (the latter being IMO a Vassarite splinter group, though I think both groups would deny this characterization). The main connection to MIRI/​CFAR is that the Vassarites recruited from the MIRI/​CFAR social network.

Alexander disagrees with the idea of describing any of these groups as "cults", he also acknowledges that several serious mental health institution 


### "The Zizians" website

A [website](http://zizians.info/)about Ziz by someone named "Apollo Mojava" has been posted. The earliest [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200413075452/http://zizians.info/)archive of the site dates back to April 2020. The website, while clearly written from the perspective of someone in the rationalist community, provides a detailed summary of the events. Some of the allegations in it have evidence provided, while other claims are unverified. 

The stated goal of the website is to warn people of Ziz and her followers, which seems like wise advice. However, Michael Vassar and the nature of Ziz's feud with him is never mentioned

Many of the claims in this Medium post link back to Ziz's blog.


#### Allegations

>at events like the Workshop on AI Safety Strategy (WAISS) run by CFAR, people would suggest ideas like taking out life insurance that would pay out to MIRI, and then [committing suicide](https://sinceriously.fyi/intersex-brains-and-conceptual-warfare/#comment-1900) to further the cause.

>Working at MIRI conferred a kind of special respect as someone who Yudkowsky and other prominent members thought were worthy to save the world. To young teenagers enamored with the Less Wrong community and its stated ideals, it’s easy to see how kids could’ve been coerced into having sex with adults working at MIRI.


### Twitter thread

Besides Vassar, Andrew Rettek and Anna Solomon were both accused of abusive behavior
