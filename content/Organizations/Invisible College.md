### Projects

##### Cheeseburger Therapy

https://cheeseburgertherapy.org/

>Cheeseburger Therapy is a text-based emotional support service where you can connect and chat with a trained peer to find clarity on your troubles.
>
 Our Helpers are peers who have gone through a 25-30 hour training program in the Cheeseburger Therapy method, rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Our goal is to empower everyday people to help others, thereby creating an alternative to traditional therapy that is accessible, consistent, and affordable - just like fast food.
