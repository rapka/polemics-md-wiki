_Not to be confused with [Authentic Relating and Circling](../Cartography/Avant-Gardea%20Arriere-Gardea/ARC.md)_

The Alignment Research Center (ARC) is an AI alignment org founded by [Paul Christiano](https://paulfchristiano.com/ai/)who formerly worked on OpenAI's safety team.

ARC's Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) project has recently been spun off into its [own organization](https://metr.org/).
