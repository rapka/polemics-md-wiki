It's Elon.

## Elon & OpenAI

Musk was [initially](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/) the co-chair of [OpenAI](OpenAI.md) alongside [Sam Altman](../../pages/Sam%20Altman.md). Semafor has [reported](https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai) that Elon attempted to take full control of the company in 2018, alleging that it was falling behind Google. This takeover failed, leading to Musk leaving the board of directors. 

Musk claimed that he would continue supporting OpenAI financially, but he didn't follow through with this promise. This loss of investment money may have been a contributing factor to OpenAI switching to a "capped profit" company structure.
