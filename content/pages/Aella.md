# KnowingLess

[website](https://knowingless.com) | [Substack](https://aella.substack.com/)

KnowingLess is the blog of rationalist sex worker Aella.


### History

https://web.archive.org/web/20130718122729/http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/07/15/the-atheist-daughter-of-a-notable-christian-apologist-shares-her-story


### Ties to Aporia

[Part 8](https://aella.substack.com/p/good-at-sex-antagonistic-seduction) of this series was a guest post by [Diane Fleischman](../../../People/Diane%20Fleishman.md) called "Antagonistic Seduction".  Fleischman also participated in a "slut squad" AMA on Aella's Substack. One of her featured post is an [extended analogy for trans kids]() ending with the conclusion that "we should be figuring out how to predict in advance where a kid will end up happiest" based on childhood traits rather than listening to the kids.


### Twitter creepiness

Aella often makes questionable tweets and posts about sex-related subjects without providing her own thoughts. For example, a [poll](https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl/status/1631078916000743424) about the age of consent included a "14 or younger" option and [another poll](https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl/status/1643703433516441602) mused on the ethics of time traveling pedophiles molesting their past selves.

### Psychedelics

Aella is a huge fan of LSD.  In her [recollections](https://knowingless.com/2019/08/17/you-will-forget/) of her past trips, she describes often giving newcomers to the drug large doses of it:
>I became an evangelist, feeding irresponsibly high doses to newcomers and feeling confused when they didnâ€™t all have the same reaction I did.

>Maybe I just need to do LSD and meditate on everyone I love dying.

### "Quis cancellat ipsos cancellores?"

https://web.archive.org/web/20211211001135/https://www.wholezero.org/stack/quis-cancellat-ipsos-cancellores

Aella has denied several key facts about this allegation, though she concedes that "consent wasn't very clearly set out". This denial was corroborated by an [ex-partner and roomate](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mooAqpyqPZnyMmPBQ/?commentId=Ar5xYxmnokXDHLtiN#Ar5xYxmnokXDHLtiN) as well as [Scott Alexander](Astral%20Codex%20Ten.md) ([link](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mooAqpyqPZnyMmPBQ/quis-cancellat-ipsos-cancellores?commentId=x8nGHFobtHxZMHfvr)). 

The accusation was written by Joshin, a member of [OAK](MAPLE.md) whose parents also live at MAPLE. The person that accused of MAPLE of covering up their sexual assault was not happy with his behavior.

>The greatest barrier to my healing has been believing that anyone who is a part of MAPLE or the broader organization will ever care enough to actually address the harm caused or to take any steps towards changing things for the better. I've since learned they do not give any fucks. My healing can't be dependent on any of them. Not Soryu. Not Alex. Not Pan. **Not Joshin or any other person involved.** They don't care if an executive director rapes an apprentice and they as an organization have mishandled it causing compounding trauma. In fact all Alex had to do was write a big a check and they took him back with open loving harms and he's obviously not being held accountable.They won't even have a conversation with me. Not one of them cares enough about their own integrity to even talk about it and frankly that seems a little off for an organizations leaders whose mission is supposedly to create wise, compassionate and awakened leadership.
