# Good Ventures

See also: [Open Philanthropy](Open%20Philanthropy.md).

[website](https://www.goodventures.org) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Ventures)

Private philanthropic fund created by Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna. Like the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative), it's an LLC rather than a legally registered non-profit. It has no employees and only serves to donate money according to Open Philanthropy's recommendations.
