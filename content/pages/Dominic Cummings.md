# Dominic Cummings

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cummings) | [Substack](https://dominiccummings.substack.com/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dominic2306)

Dominic Cummings was the Chief Advisor to UK PM Boris Johnson from July 24, 2019 to November 13, 2020.

Cummings maintains a [reading list](https://dominiccummings.substack.com/p/reading-list) on his Substack where he recommends a number of rationalists:
>[Yudkowsky’s](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/sequences) _[Sequences](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/sequences)_, the core document of the ‘rationalist’ movement. And a very recent post, _[AGI Ruin](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities)_, summarising the arguments on why artificial general intelligence is so dangerous and why controlling these dangers is so very hard.

>[Follow Zvi.](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/10/best-of-dont-worry-about-the-vase/) He’s a very unusual thinker and much more right much more often than just about anybody, partly because of how he thinks. If you read his blogs and trusted him on covid over the entire CDC/FDA/WHO bureaucracies, you’d have come out far ahead. He replied to Yudkowsky’s AGI ruin [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LLRtjkvh9AackwuNB/on-a-list-of-lethalities) as did Paul Christiano [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CoZhXrhpQxpy9xw9y/where-i-agree-and-disagree-with-eliezer). (NB. You often read versions of ‘those really at the edge of this research do not predict fast timetables’. This is false. I know some of them. Those who think very fast timetables are plausible _do not talk about it publicly_ because (partly) they worry about the effects of their comments. Predictions on AGI can be Straussian. Many academics predicted OpenAI’s approach would not work but have been [proved repeatedly wrong](https://www.gwern.net/Scaling-hypothesis).)

>Follow Julia Galef. Her recent book, _The Scout Mindset_, was excellent.

On Twitter, Cummings only follows two people: [Gwern](Gwern.md) and [Laeeth Isharc](https://kaleidic.substack.com/), a hedge fund manager.

The Center for Global Development released a paper in 2020 called [The UK as an Effective Altruist](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/uk-effective-altruist)analyzing Boris Johnson's government through the lens of EA.
