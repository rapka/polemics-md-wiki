# Longview Philanthropy

[website](https://www.longview.org/)

Longview is part of [Effective Ventures](CEA.md).

### Funding
From their [about page]():

>Current funders include Martin Crowley, Tom Crowley, Likith Govindaiah, Justin Rockefeller, Rafael Albert and several private philanthropists and foundations. Historical funders include Ben Delo.

It's unclear who the "several private philanthropists" are. (TODO: look into this)

The website footer also says the following:
> Longview Philanthropy is a project of Longview Inc. Ltd (UK company number 14444004) and Longview Philanthropy USA Inc. (EIN 93-2664730). Longview Inc. Ltd and Longview Philanthropy USA Inc. are separate entities that collaborate closely under the “Longview Philanthropy” name.

(TODO: figure out what's up with the non-profit structure)
### Grants

As part of their [AI grants](https://www.longview.org/artificial-intelligence/), Longview has donated to:
- The Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence at UC Berkeley 
- Model Evaluation & Threat Research @ [ARC](ARC.md)
- The new mechanistic interpretability lab at Harvard

### Events

Longview has held several and participated in events for the EA/Longtermism communities. 

- Longview hosted a "small group of major donors, with talks from experts at [Open Philanthropy](Open%20Philanthropy.md) the [Future of Humanity Institute](FHI.md), and [DeepMind](DeepMind.md)" in Oxford. A [page](https://www.escapethecity.org/opportunity/head-of-events-at-longview-philanthropy) on escapethecity.org described the event as hosting "major philanthropists; policymakers including representatives from the UN and OECD; academic experts in AI, biosecurity, global priorities research; top YouTubers; key EA figures"
- They hosted a "media retreat" in NY in 2022 "focused on encouraging impartial, scope-sensitive, truth-seeking media".  They claim that "over 200 project ideas were borne out of this retreat" but there appears to be no other information about this event or what these ideas were.
- Longview's founder and CEO both attended [FLI's](FLI.md)  2019 [Beneficial AGI conference](https://futureoflife.org/event/beneficial-agi-2019/).
