# Americans for AI Safety

Americans for AI Safety is a Super PAC related to AI existential risk created by [Gladstone AI](Gladstone%20AI.md) co-founder Mark Beall. Both Gladstone and Americans for AI Safety were covered by Time in an [exclusive report](https://time.com/6898967/ai-extinction-national-security-risks-report/) about AI risk.

According to [FEC filings](https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00871582/?tab=about-committee), the treasurer of the SuperPAC is [Brendan Steinhauser](http://www.brendansteinhauser.com/about.html), a Republican political consultant author of "The Conservative Revolution: How to Win the Battle for College Campuses". Coincidentally, Steinhauser was also [named](https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023831_2023829_2025198,00.html) on Time's 40 under 40 list in 2017. Former House majority leader Dick Armey has praised Steinhauser's work for the modern conservative movement, saying he **"helped to create and build the tea party movement from an idea to a political force**".

The Super PAC was organized through a firm called Campaign Financial Services with a PO box address in Bethesda, Maryland. Other political groups registered to this PO box include:
