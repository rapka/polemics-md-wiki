# Grimes

Grimes is a pop musician and [Elon Musk's](Elon%20Musk.md) ex-wife.

### Elon

Elon [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/993572598381514753) "Rococo basilisk" in 2018, a reference to Roko's Baslisk (from [LessWrong](LessWrong.md)) and the [Rococo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo) artistic movement from the 1700's.

Grimes had already talked about used Roko's Basilisk as a concept in a 2015 interview with [Fuse.tv](https://www.fuse.tv/videos/2015/12/grimes-fuse-first-interview-flesh-without-blood):
>Rococo Basilisk is like....she's doomed to be eternally tortured by an artificial intelligence but she's kind of like Marie Antoinette.

An anonymous source [claimed](https://pagesix.com/2018/05/07/elon-musk-quietly-dating-musician-grimes/) to Page Six that this LessWrong reference is what led Elon Musk and Grimes to start dating:
>“Elon was researching the idea of joking about Rococo Basilisk, and when he saw Grimes had already joked about it, he reached out to her,” says the insider. “Grimes said this was the first time in three years that anyone understood the joke. They were both poking fun at AI.”

Grime would go on to have several kids with Musk before divorcing him.
