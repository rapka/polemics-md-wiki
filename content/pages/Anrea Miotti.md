 Andrea Miotti is the executive director of [Control AI](https://controlai.com/about-us), a company that claims there is a "10-25% chance (AI) will cause catastrophe for human civilisation". Control AI appears to have recently pivoted their PR from focusing on AGI x-risk to deepfakes, a much more pressing and visible issue.

Before founding Control AI in October 2023, Miotti was the Head of Strategy and Governance for [Conjecture](Conjecture.md), where he still serves as an advisor. 

### AGI doom truck publicity stunt

Shortly after its launch, Control AI [rented a truck](https://twitter.com/dw2/status/1716515784355160495) to drive around London displaying a message about x-risk. The ad says that "Big Tech is playing God" and features a video of Dr. Paul Christiano of the [Alignment Research Center](Alignment%20Research%20Center.md) claiming that there is a "50-50 chance of doom shortly after you have AI systems that are at a human level".
