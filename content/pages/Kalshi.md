Kalshi is a prediction market similar to [Manifold](Manifold.md) that is regulated by the CFTC. Kalshi uses [LedgerX](https://ledgerx.com/), a cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform, as its clearinghouse, a service that was owned by [FTX](FTX.md) until its collapse. Kalshi would later [put in a bid](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-21/ftx-s-ledgerx-attracts-bids-from-firms-including-miami-exchange) for LedgerX.
